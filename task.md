# Operators, Statements and Syntax

1. create a new branch from the current one _hw3_
2. In that branch, create a few JS files with exercise numbers, for example task1.js, task2.js, etc.
3. In those files, implement solutions for the tasks.

**TASK 1**

> Write a JavaScript program to pick a specified number of unique random elements from a given array (so that no element is selected more than once).
> Sample Output:  
> Original array:  
> [12, 34, 23, 56]  
> 2 random elements from the array.  
> [34, 12]  
> 3 random elements from the array.  
> [56, 12, 34]
>
> If an element is already selected, it cannot be selected again.

**TASK 2**

> Write a Javascript program to compute the sum of elements in a given array.  
> Sample Output:  
> Original array(array can be changed and function should return correct sum):  
> [12, 34, 23, 56]  
> Sum of the values of the above array:  
> 125

**TASK 3**

> Write a Javascript program to split a delimited string into an array.  
> Sample output:  
> Original delimited string:  
> “Red, Green, Blue, 1, White, 3, 4, 5, 7” String to arrays:  
> ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "White"] > [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]

**TASK 4**

> Write a function which returns a factorial of a given number with a loop.  
> Sample output:  
> getFactorial(5) => 120

**TASK 5**

> write a function which returns a Fibonacci value for a given number with a loop.  
> Sample output:  
> getFibonacci(10) => 55

**TASK 6**

> Task: Write a function checkEvenOdd(n) that uses a ternary operator to return 'Even' if the number is even and 'Odd' if it's odd.
> Sample output:  
> checkEvenOdd(5) => Odd

**TASK 7**

> Task: Write a function checkNumber(n) that returns 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Zero' based on the input number.
> Sample output:  
> checkNumber(5) => Positive
> checkNumber(0) => Zero

**TASK 8**

> Task: Write a function getDayName(day) that returns the name of the day for a number (1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday) using a switch statement.
> Sample output:  
> getDayName(1) => Monday
> getDayName(20) => Invalid day

**TASK 9**

> Task: Write a function printEvenNumbers(limit) that prints all even numbers from 1 to the given limit using a 'for' loop.

**TASK 10**

> Task: Write a function countDown(n) that prints numbers from n to 1 using a 'while' loop.

**TASK 11**

> Task: Write a function canDrive(age, hasLicense) that returns true if the person is 18 or older and has a valid license, otherwise false.

**TASK 12**

> Task: Write a function swap(a, b) that swaps two variables using array destructuring and return that variables

**TASK 13**

> Task: Write a function getUserEmail(user) that returns the email of the user if it exists, or 'Email not found' using optional chaining.

5. once done, create pull request into current branch _hw3_
